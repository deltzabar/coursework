# coursework
the stuff for my GCSE coursework
the GAME! is the code with the actual game written in it. it's a pretty uninteresting game to play sorry.
the database file is needed for the SQL to run at the end - so that scores are saved between games
you don't really need the text file because the part that uses it is commented out but should you choose to use it it's there...
